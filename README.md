### Mii
This is the final implementation of the Mii environment, made to be as portable, efficient, and pleasant to use as possible.

#### dependencies
Mii has no dependencies. The source is fully POSIX-compliant and will build on almost any UNIX system.
`make` is required to execute the makefile, but it is there for convienence.

#### installation
To install Mii to your computer under `/usr`:
```bash
$ cd mii-release
$ make install PREFIX=/usr
```

To integrate Mii with your shell, execute `mii install`.
The application will interactively guide the install.
